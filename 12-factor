Twelve-Factor is a way of setting up an app so that it has the most efficient running and development experience. The twelve factors are codbase, dependencies, config, backing services, build, release, run, processes port binding, concurrency, disposability, development/production parity, logs, and administrative processes. Generally, to me, it seemed like this 12-factor system works to produce an app in the least restrictive but most efficent way. This means combining parts of development and production quickly, but making sure that different parts of development are produced seperately so that there cannot be confusion. One of the parts of this system that seemed to be extremely importantwas the way that build, release, and run should all be different processes. Overlapping them could cause major problems. Another part of the twelve-factor system that seemed vital was to decrease the gaps between production and development. This will cause less problems in the long-run if the time after which something is developed and produced is lowered, the amount of people working directly with the system is minimized, and comparable systems are used for development and production. 
One part of the twelve-factor system that I did not understand was the port binding process. Is this a way to attach an app system to the internet? 
I was also a bit confused about what exactly config is. Is this the way that we set up the system pre-development?
