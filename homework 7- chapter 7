This chapter focuses primarily on requirements and specifications. One of the most important factors of requirements is to remember not to let them be the sole driving force. This is an important thing to remember as a programmer, but also when starting a project. Requirements are primarily a guide, not the sole outcome that is expected from a piece of code. This chapter also notes that it is pertinent to listen to your gut when beginning and working on a project. There is a certain amount of training that each programmer goes through and continues to go through, leading them to know best when and how to program at the beginning of a project. Lastly, there was a portion about the limits of formal parameters. Overall, this chapter presents a caution to programers about getting too stuck in one particular way. It is important to be flexible, whether through parameters or by not worrying about the requirements specificity.
